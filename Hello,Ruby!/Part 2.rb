Hello, Ruby!

Another method that can be used to display output to the screen is print.
For example:

print "Hello World"


This code displays the same output as before, except that the puts automatically adds a new line after the output, while print does not.

For example:
puts "Hi"
print "there"
print "Ruby"


Result:
Hi
thereRuby
