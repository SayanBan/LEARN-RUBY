Data Types

All variables in Ruby can be of all data types.

Ruby automatically determines data type by the value assigned to the variable.

For example: 
x = 42 # integer
y = 1.58 # floating point value
z = "Hello" # string

You can reassign a different value to a variable at any time.

To insert the value of a variable into a double quote string (a string is a sequence of characters, such as "Hello"), use the # symbol and curly brackets with the variable name.

For example:
age = 42
puts "He is #{age} years old"

# outputs "He is 42 years old"


It is good practice to use the same data type in a single variable all over your application. It helps you to avoid mistakes.
