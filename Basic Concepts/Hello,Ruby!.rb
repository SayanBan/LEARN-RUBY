Hello, Ruby!

PART 1

Let's create our very first Ruby program, the classic "Hello World" program.
For this, we use the built-in puts method.

puts "Hello World"


This code will output the text "Hello World" to the screen.
All text values (strings) must be enclosed in single or double quotes.


PART 2

Hello, Ruby!

Another method that can be used to display output to the screen is print.
For example:

print "Hello World"


This code displays the same output as before, except that the puts automatically adds a new line after the output, while print does not.
For example:

puts "Hi"

print "there"
print "Ruby"

Result:

Hi
thereRuby
