Comments

PART 1

Comments are lines of annotation within Ruby code that are ignored at program runtime.

In Ruby, the hashtag symbol is used to create a single-line comment.

For example:

# printing some text
puts "Hi there"

Everything following the hashtag symbol on that line is ignored when the program is run.

PART 2

You can also create multi-line comments.

Everything between the =begin and =end reserved words are considered a comment:

=begin
   This comment
   spans multiple 
   lines
=end

puts "Hello"


Adding comments to your code is a good practice. It facilitates a clear understanding of the code for you and for others who read it.
